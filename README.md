# Human Computer Interaction Lab - Roomba Study
Research the impact of neurotic behavior exhibited by autonomous robots on humans. Our research focuses on examining human willingness to maintain an autonomous Roomba robot when it becomes stuck and requires maintenance. The Roomba is an everyday robot that autonomously performs its tasks and returns to its docking station upon completion. Our project aims to investigate whether humans are more inclined to provide maintenance support for the robot in such situations.
This repository contains the script which runs on the roomba to communicate with a custom made application on the phone for teleoperation.
Google Firebase is used as a mediator to create the link between the Roomba and the Controller Application.
